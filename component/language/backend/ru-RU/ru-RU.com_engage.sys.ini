COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_LABEL="Maximum comment nesting"
COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_MAX_LEVEL_DESC="<p>Comments can be nested up to this many levels deep. For example, 3 levels means that you have top level comments (1<sup>st</sup> level), replies to top level comments (2<sup>nd</sup> level) and replies to the replies (3<sup>rd</sup> level). Keep this relative low for more cohesive discussion and more reasonable display of comments.</p><p>The default is 3, similar to what is used by other content comment systems your visitors are familiar with, e.g. Discus etc. Set it to 2 to simulate what social media such as Facebook or YouTube do. Use 1 to disallow nesting (only top level comments allowed).</p><p><strong>THIS SETTING IS NOT APPLIED RETROACTIVELY.</strong> It only takes effect for new replies. Setting it to a lower value won't “flatten” your existing comment threads.</p><p>This setting CAN NOT be overriden for specific categories or articles.</p>"

Use Global uses the default list limit from the site's Global Configuration.</p><p><strong>Watch out!</strong> Using the larger options (especially 500 or All) may result in a blank page, HTTP error 504 Gateway Timeout or very slow server response on content items with a very large number of comments. We recommend using a more conservative setting such as 50 or even 20.</p>"

COM_ENGAGE_CONFIG_FILTER_MODE_DESC="<p>Akeeba Engage offers three modes for filtering the HTML content of comments to make them safe:</p><ul><li><strong>Joomla Text Filters</strong>. This uses Joomla's Text Filters options, defined in Global Configuration, using Joomla's own HTML filtering code.</li><li><strong>HTML Purifier</strong>. This uses the more robust HTML Purifier library. When a user group is set up to use No HTML filtering it falls back to Joomla's code that strips all HTML tags.</li><li><strong>HTML Purifier (allow minimal HTML)</strong>. Like the option above, but when a user group is set up to use No HTML filtering we actually allow a <em>very</em> small subset of safe HTML tags. Recommended so that Guest users will be able to submit formatted comments without risking your site's security.</li></ul>"

This allows you to have a different HTML filtering level per user group but it can be unsafe under some circumstances.</p><p>When disabled HTML Purifier will use the “HTML Purifier whitelist“ option below for <strong>all users</strong>. This is the safest approach but prevents you from using advanced tags, embedding videos etc even if you are a Super user!</p>"
